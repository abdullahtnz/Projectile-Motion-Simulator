# Projectile-Motion-Simulator
A simulation code written in Golang that can be used to both calculate and visualize projectile motion in physics.

#Calculation Part of programme

You can calculate projectile motion properties with nearly 0 error (some of them have 0.04% error). You can arrange the air resistance ( 0.01 dt ) consideration.

What outputs the programme gives you:
- Initial velocity at X direction
- Initial velocity at Y direction
- Final velocity at X direction ( at final point A )
- Final velocity at Y direction ( at final point A )
- Time of flight ( time passed )
- Range ( displacement in X direction )
- Max Height

#Visualization Part of programme

In this part, using and evaluating the outputs of the calculation part, the programme generates an image called "PMvisualization.png" in golang folder.

What this images includes:
- Trajectory
- Final point at X direction
- Max height
Note: The Graph is x,y graph.
